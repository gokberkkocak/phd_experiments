# Repository for PhD experiments

## Data

Contains the data for pattern mining problems from [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/183025611.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/183025611) and some additional portfolio training data generated from feature extraction scripts from scripts

## Models

Contains essence models for 5 pattern mining problems and minimal hitting set models for configuration selection.

## Results

Contains the experiment database which can be read by ```rrr``` tool in the software. Also contains training results for the portfolio and generated plots for instance generation and mrcpsp experiments.

## Scripts

Contains scripts to run the experiments with the given tools and data.
