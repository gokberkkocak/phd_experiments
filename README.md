# Repository for PhD experiments [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.5931360.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5931360)



## Data

Contains the data for pattern mining problems from our [ECAI2020 paper data](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3675340) and some additional portfolio training data generated from feature extraction scripts from scripts

## Models

Contains essence models for 5 pattern mining problems and minimal hitting set models for configuration selection.

## Results

Contains the experiment database which can be read by ```rrr``` tool in the software. Also contains training results for the portfolio and generated plots for instance generation and mrcpsp experiments.

## Scripts

Contains scripts to run the experiments with the given tools and data.

## Software

Contains the software/tools that are extended (SavileRow and Conjure) or fully developed from scratch  (all others) for the thesis.

SavileRow (with commit hash 23d3ecb54fd57acdce5e81fc207a22fb2d3b23b0) is given with a zip file rather than a submodule since it is included in a private repository. All others are given in a submodule with relevant commit.
